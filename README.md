# Vision I
Vision I is an AI-based intelligent visual assistance system designed to help visually impaired users perceive and navigate their surroundings through real-time voice guidance.  The project leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to process live camera input, detect objects in the environment, and convert visual information into meaningful audio feedback. Vision I focuses on building a modular and extensible architecture that separates visual perception, feature extraction, decision making, and user interaction.  In its current stage, Vision I implements a real-time visual perception pipeline using a pretrained object detection model to identify obstacles and entities in the scene. The system is designed to evolve incrementally, with future phases introducing distance estimation, contextual understanding, intelligent navigation decisions, and enhanced user guidance.  Vision I is developed as a final-year capstone project with an emphasis on clarity, explainability, and real-world applicability, following professional software engineering and AI system design practices.
